- Learn **Computation**

- Learn **Computer Organization**

- Learn **Data** **Hierarchy**

- Learn **The Classification of Programming Language** 



Computers can make calculations and logical decisions with a very high speed beyond human ability. On average **Personal Computer (PC)** today can execute billions of instructions every second, but **Supercomputer** can execute instructions reaching **Quadrillion** per second or equivalent to thousands of trillions per second. Very astonishing.

One of the **supercomputers** named **Tianhe-2** developed by **National University of Defense Technology**, is capable of performing **33 Quadrillion** calculations per second. Approximately, (33.86 **Petaflops**). But the development competition of supercomputer was again won by the United States after they made the latest **supercomputer** with the name **Summit (OLCF-4)** which has the ability to 200 Flops.

**Flops** or floating point operations per second is one measure used to determine the **performance** of a computer. Used to do **scientific computation** that can open up business potential worth hundreds of millions **dollars**, innovation and industrial revolution that can bring a company or country to open a new history.
